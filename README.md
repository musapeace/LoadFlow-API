# Load Flow API ðŸ”Œâš¡

A simple Django REST API that performs load flow (power flow) analysis for a 3-bus power system using the Gauss-Seidel method.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Add, update, and delete:
  - Buses
  - Lines (with impedance)
  - Loads (real & reactive)
- Compute voltage magnitudes at each bus
- Uses Y-bus matrix and Gauss-Seidel iteration
